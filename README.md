## Inspiration
We were tired of constantly being wary of sites or links on the internet, or if our emails were secure. As a result, we decided to make a hub that would check for people whether a link was safe, or if an email had been compromised.

## What it does
It essentially allows a user to copy and paste a link into the Chrome extension, letting them know whether or not their email has been compromised, or using a comparison between 92 antiviruses, if the link is secure.

## Reflection
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into several issues along the way, the first being how in the world to make this into a Chrome extension. In all honesty, we are all freshmen who don't have much experience in coding in general, therefore learning all the nitty-gritty of making a Chrome extension was a lot. Aside from that, we also ran into several bugs along the way, one example being how to detect links that we didn't personally put into the code. This was exceptionally difficult, as we didn't know about the mutations handler before, and from a background with little to no Javascript, was a big deal. Additionally, one of us had to learn how to do the front end, another had to learn graphic designing in terms of pixel art, for this project to then finally come together in the end.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of the challenges we overcame aforementioned. As not-so-experienced coders, or artists, it truly was a difficult journey, but with a beautiful project, we can say we are truly marshmallow guards now.

### Conclusion
Well, we are hoping to further complete it in the future. There are some implementations we couldn't implement despite the assistance of 5 different mentors T-T, such as a toggle button that is then linked to the hover and turns on or off the hover effects, or the hover effect that immediately fetches the link without actually clicking on the link, and processes it in our extension.
