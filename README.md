### Conclusion
I learned a lot of new skills and concepts doing this project.  I definitely spent more time then I initially thought I would've, but it turned out great. I realized that there are so many components that must be considered - not just the technical aspect of it, but also with the design, implementation, etc. - in order to construct a full-fledged project with a feature set that works in tandum with each other and delivers the optimal experience to the user.  The creative freedom I had with this project was both a positive and negative because it allowed me test many different ideas but also prevented the development timeline from being linear. Also, one of my goals was to avoid an *amateur-ish* design; consequently, there were so many minute elements that ended up consuming most of my time developing and/or fixing.  I also wanted to keep the design appropriate to the theme that was already set in testudo;  I wanted to make it look like it belonged there. I learned how to handle promises and asynchronous calling, and my prior experience in a networking class (CMSC417) definitely helped me here since I had already dealt with RPCs in a p2p network when reconstructing Chord.  I also finally learned how to navigate the browser inspect tool to view/make appropriate changes, which accelerated my workflow significantly. Overall, I felt like this project was extremely useful and fun to make. Now, I just have to get people to download it :).
